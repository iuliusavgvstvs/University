The program lets you perform CRUD operations on a list of students and homeworks
through a command line interface. You can also give a student a grade for a 
specific homework.
The data persistance is a XML document for every entity(student, homework, grade).
The program contains tests(junit), validators for entities, exceptions as well,
writing and loading text from XML files with DOM parser. 
Every time you grade a student, the program creates a new XML document with the name of
the graded student wich contains details about the student, homework and grade.
There are also filter functions that lets you filter the students and grades by specific
criteria(for example: all the students from a group or all the students with a 
given homework).
