The program does almost everything that ConsoleProject does but this time using a graphical 
user interface. 

The program lets you perform CRUD operations on a list of students and homeworks
through a command line interface. You can also give a student a grade for a 
specific homework.
The data persistance is a XML document for every entity(student, homework, grade).
The program contains tests(junit), validators for entities, exceptions as well,
writing and loading text from XML files with DOM parser. 

There are also filter functions that lets you filter the students and grades by specific
criteria(for example: all the students from a group or all the students with a 
given homework). The filters named as "Raports" are shown using a table view + a 
bar chart in a new window every time the respectively button is pressed.
